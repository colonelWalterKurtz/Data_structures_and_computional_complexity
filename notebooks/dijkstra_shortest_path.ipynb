    "# Time complexity of Dijkstra shortest path algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest paths from a certain vertex to all the paths reached from it. It is an example of a greedy algorithm. The weights of the graph must be non-negative.\n",
    "The implementation code of Dijkstra's algorithm in this case is array-based. It is not optimal because the search for the minimum value in the loop is linear $O(n)$ by which the algorithm eventually achieves a quadratic complexity of $O(n^2)$.\n",
